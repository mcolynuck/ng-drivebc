# ng-drivebc
AngularJS exercise to recreate functionality from the DriveBC.ca website

The main purpose of this project was to create my first non-tutorial or study project based on Angular JS using a real-world example.  The example was based on the DriveBC.ca website on which I was a developer for a few years which helped me avoid having to do the extra leg-work of the design criteria step of the interface as well as the underlying technologies such as data formatting, etc.

As I was only interested in the Angular JS part of the work, the amount of time I spent on design and CSS/SASS was much less than it would have been normally.

The 'About' page in the project details more about each page and the Angular JS features / problems involved on that section of the project.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

(not yet implemented) Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
